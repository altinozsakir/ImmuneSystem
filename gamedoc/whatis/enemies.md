Bacteria (basic grunt)

Purpose: Test your baseline DPS and lane control.

Quirk: Some have a Capsule that knocks off 1 Mark when they hit.

Counter: Macrophage at a choke + Marks → Complement Pad finishes; Mast slows keep them in the kill zone.

Virus (fast skirmisher)

Purpose: Slip through gaps and Infect host nodes (spawns tanky adds that charge HQ).

Counter: Drop Interferon Shout (hero Q) inside lane, add a B-Cell for ranged coverage; slows/snares help a lot.

Fungi (armored tank)

Purpose: Soak damage and ignore weak walls; forces sustained DPS checks.

Counter: Long exposure in a choke: B-Cell focus fire + NET Pit (root) + any ROS/DoT upgrades.

Biofilm Engineer (elite support)

Purpose: Project a 300-HP shield onto nearby bacteria so pushes don’t die.

Counter: Mast Cell Trap pulses (degranulate) to pop shields fast; then focus fire.

Infected Host (virus-spawned add)

Purpose: Become a tanky distraction that beelines for HQ after a Virus infection.

Counter: Apply Marks, let Macrophage chew, and use Apoptosis Strike (hero R) to execute at low HP.

Mutator Virus (boss)

Purpose: Final exam—every 25% HP it rotates immunities (e.g., slow-immune → mark-immune → +50% physical resist) and spawns Infected Hosts.

Counter: Adapt each phase: swap damage sources (B-Cell/ROS vs. phys), time Interferon Shout, keep Marks rolling when allowed, and maintain a solid choke.

Not enemies, but they matter

• Toxin Cloud (hazard)

Purpose: Drift through lanes and lower tower fire rate, making pushes harder.

Counter: Interferon Shout to disperse; or kite around until it moves.

• Phase Affixes (modifiers) — Frenzied (+speed), Thick Membranes (−phys dmg taken), Hemorrhage (DoT pools).

Purpose: Make certain waves/nights spicier.

Counter: Adjust builds (more control vs. Frenzied, more non-phys damage vs. Thick Membranes, careful positioning vs. Hemorrhage).
