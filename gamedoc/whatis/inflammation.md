What it is
Inflammation is the “heat” meter of your immune response — how hard the body is pushing back right now.

What it gives you (good)
As Inflammation rises, your towers & hero hit harder and execute thresholds go up (finishing low-HP enemies gets easier).

What it costs (bad)
High Inflammation taxes your next phase’s ATP income (economy). In our rules: the higher it gets, the more ATP you lose next phase.

When it goes up

Sustained, heavy fighting (big waves, lots of damage dealt/taken)

Crisis moments like Fever Spike

Some high-impact effects/perks may add a little, by design

When it goes down
During Sleep, the body consolidates and Inflammation clears a bit (but not to zero unless you kept it low).

Why it exists (design purpose)
It’s a risk–reward dial: push harder now for damage, pay later with weaker income. It makes timing and the Body-Time phases matter.

How to manage it

Use control tools (Mast slow, NET snare, Mucus Walls) to prevent messy brawls.

Pick Treg Control (perk) when it’s getting high.

Stagger upgrades and don’t overcommit right before a new phase if your economy will be taxed.

Handle Fever quickly so it doesn’t spike Inflammation.

What it isn’t
Not a game-over bar — that’s Sepsis. Inflammation is tempo & economy pressure, not the loss condition.
