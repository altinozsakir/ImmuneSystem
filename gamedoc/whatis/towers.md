Lymph HQ (Base)

What: Your core. If it dies, you lose.

Purpose: Revive point for hero; later gives small heal/income aura.

Use when: Always protect; place support around it late game.

Metabolic Hub (Economy)

What: Income generator (ATP).

Purpose: Funds all builds and upgrades.

Use when: Early and safely; keep them alive for steady income.

Tip: Upgrade to Mito Park (more income, fragile) or Liver Depot (tougher aura for nearby hubs).

Macrophage Post (Melee damage + execute)

What: Short-range bruiser.

Purpose: Shreds frontliners and executes low-HP enemies.

Use when: At choke points to finish what slows/snare hold.

Tip: Pick Phagosome Forge (higher execute) or Opsonin Beacon (adds Marks for team damage).

B-Cell Turret (Long-range damage + debuff)

What: Ranged antibody tower.

Purpose: Consistent DPS and Neutralize (enemies deal less damage).

Use when: To cover long straights and support melees.

Tip: IgG = strong single target; IgA = multishot lane coverage.

Mast Cell Trap (AoE slow + pulses)

What: Control pad that slows in bursts.

Purpose: Keeps waves inside kill zones; can add Marks on pulses.

Use when: Before/inside a choke to hold packs in place.

Tip: Extend slow duration for control or add +1 Mark for damage synergy.

NET Pit (Snare trap)

What: Sticky net that roots briefly.

Purpose: Hard stop so towers can focus fire; refreshes at event start.

Use when: Right on the choke or just before the Macrophage.

Tip: Upgrade to bigger radius (more catches) or ROS DoT (extra chip).

Mucus Wall (Path blocker/rerouter)

What: Placeable barrier on wall nodes.

Purpose: Reroute lanes into your best kill zone; slows big enemies.

Use when: To funnel multiple lanes through your traps/turrets.

Tip: Tight Junction = tankier wall; Cilia Gate = open/close on demand.

Dendritic Outpost (Tech/perk economy)

What: Support post that grants Cytokines at Sleep.

Purpose: Fuels Chrono-Perk choices; tagging elites improves perk quality.

Use when: Mid-run once you have basic defenses.

Tip: Place where it can “see” elites you regularly kill.

Complement Pad (Hazard finisher)

What: Pad that tries to lyse (insta-kill) Marked enemies under a threshold.

Purpose: Converts your Marks into free kills near capillary pinches.

Use when: Downstream of Mark sources (Macrophage/Mast) at tight corners.

Quick “when in doubt” build order

1–2 Metabolic Hubs in safe spots (income).

Macrophage at first choke → B-Cell covering lane.

Add Mast then NET to lock the choke.

Use Mucus Wall to reroute a second lane into that same choke.

Mid-run, drop a Dendritic Outpost for perks.

Add a Complement Pad near the choke to cash in Marks.
