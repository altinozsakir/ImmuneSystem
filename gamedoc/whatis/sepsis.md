Here’s the simple, step-by-step purpose of Sepsis in our game:

What it is
Sepsis is the global danger bar. It measures how close the body is to a system-wide collapse.

When it goes up

Breach damage: Enemies get past your defenses and hit tissue/HQ → Sepsis rises.

Cascade losses: If several structures die in a short time, Sepsis spikes (bigger jump).

What it does (game rule)
It’s a hard loss condition. If the bar ever reaches max, you immediately lose the run—even if the HQ still has health.

Why we have it (design purpose)

Turns “one leaky lane” into a whole-board problem, so you can’t ignore small breaches.

Forces proactive play (walls, control, repairs) instead of pure turtling at HQ.

Creates clear stakes and a single, readable “you’re in trouble” meter.

What it doesn’t do (in the prototype)

It doesn’t drain on its own. Treat Sepsis as essentially permanent during a run (you prevent it; you don’t heal it).

How you manage it

Prevent breaches with Mucus Walls, Mast/NET at chokes, and timely upgrades.

Use Emergency Build tokens to plug holes mid-crisis.

Repair in Evening (cheaper) to avoid cascade losses next phase.

Prioritize threats that cause big bursts (elites, infected hosts).

That’s it: Sepsis is your run-wide health bar for the whole body—keep it low by stopping breaches, or the body goes down regardless of HQ HP.
