Absolutely—here’s the big picture of what you’ve built so far, in clean, step-by-step layers. Think of it as the game loop from systems → world → combat → feedback.

1) Foundation (Day 1)

Project shell: Unity 6 URP (Forward+), 60 FPS target.

Camera: Cinemachine camera (Framing Transposer), Confiner set; view framed around the pawn.

Input: Input Actions (Move / Dash / Ability1–3 / Build / Cancel).

Time control: TimeScaleService (stack-safe slow/restore).

✅ Smoke test: scene loads, no console errors; pawn moves & dash works.

2) World & Placement (Day 2)

Lanes & paths: Spline lanes (2–3) for enemies; EnemyMoverSpline moves along and exposes DistanceToGoal.

Spawner: EnemySpawner/EnemySpawnerSpline instantiates enemies onto a lane, cadence/count configurable.

Build nodes: BuildNode prefabs (Capillary/Lymph/Barrier), hover highlight; raycast to BuildSlot layer only.

Placement: PlacementController with a non-blocking ghost, “show only when valid,” placementYOffset, and slot checks.

2.5) Test Harness & Fixes

Drop-in scene test (spawners + nodes + HUD) to validate pathing and placement.

Typical fixes you hit: ground collider, camera frame/offset, ghost popping, missing methods—now patched.

3) Circadian pacing & HUD (Day 3)

BodyClockDirector: Phases (Sleep → Morning → PostMeal → Evening), durations, colors, and events:

OnPhaseChanged(BodyPhase)

OnMultipliersChanged(PhaseMultipliers) → { atpIncome, enemySpeed, repairCost }

OnPlanningWindow(bool) (slow-time window start/end)

Planning Windows: At Sleep & PostMeal start, push timeScale 0.35 for ~7s (unscaled timing, auto-restore).

Clock HUD: ClockRingHUD (ring fill for phase progress, rotating cursor for day progress, pips for upcoming planning windows, wedge during active window).

Hooks:

Enemies read enemySpeed (via adapter).

Economy originally via ATPWallet (later superseded by ResourceBank).

3.5) Combat core & economy (Day 3.5)

Economy: ResourceBank (ATP/Cytokines) with 6-second unscaled tick × phase atpIncome; HUD binder shows ATP.

Damage model:

DamagePacket → passed to Health.ApplyDamage (order: resist → mark multiplier → HP; supports Execute).

StatusEffects → Mark (bonus damage taken), Neutralize (reduce enemy outgoing damage; capped).

Health events drive popups & death; DestroyOnDeath removes enemies cleanly.

Towers:

TowerBase (range, fire rate, cost).

TowerTargetingGoal (closest-to-goal using DistanceToGoal).

TowerShooter + ProjectileHoming (homing, applies Mark/Neutralize/Execute).

Prefabs: Macrophage Post (adds Mark, executes <15% HP), B-Cell Turret (applies Neutralize, max 2).

Placement + costs:

PlacementController reads TowerBase.buildCostATP, calls ResourceBank.SpendATP().

Blocks placement if insufficient ATP; optional deny SFX.

Damage popups:

DamagePopupSpawner + DamagePopup show damage and remaining HP over the hit.

4) Crowd control & risk meters (Day 4)

CC system: CrowdControl on enemies aggregates slows (sum → resist → cap at −70%) and snares (speed=0). Pure logic; VFX separate.

Speed adapter: EnemySpeedPhaseAdapter now multiplies baseSpeed × phaseSpeed × CC.SpeedMultiplier every frame.

CC towers:

Mast Trap (MastTrapPulse): periodic AoE slow (−40% for 3s every 8s) + Mark via degranulation pulse.

NET Pit (NETPitAura): applies snare 2.5s on entry (refreshes only when re-entering).

Risk meters:

InflammationMeter (+Scriptable MeterConfig): raises stakes; provides Damage bonus and Execute bonus; defines ATP tax next phase (−10% per +2 levels over baseline).

SepsisMeter (+config): rises on breach; defeat at 100.

GoalZone adds Sepsis when enemies reach the end and deletes them.

GlobalCombatModifiers.Bind(Inflammation) → projectiles read global DamageMult and ExecuteBonus.

ATPTaxAdapter listens to phase changes, applies per-phase income tax to ResourceBank via an external multiplier hook.

Meters HUD: MetersHUD animates Inflammation & Sepsis bars (vertical filled images, color-lerped by config).

How it all talks (runtime flow)

Clock ticks → fires phase events

UI recolors ring; planning window may slow time (0.35).

Enemy speed & ATP tick scale by multipliers; next-phase ATP tax is latched from Inflammation.

Spawner feeds lanes with enemies**;** each enemy moves along its spline

CC and phase scale their speed; snare sets speed to 0; slow reduces speed down to the −70% cap after resist.

Placement gates towers by ATP cost

Valid slot? Enough ATP? Place & deduct; ghost stays hidden unless valid.

Targeting & firing

Towers acquire the closest to goal in range, shoot homing projectiles.

On hit

Projectile composes a DamagePacket (with Mark/Neutralize/Execute), also applying Inflammation buffs.

Health.ApplyDamage: resist → mark multiplier → HP; spawns damage popup (damage + remaining HP).

If HP ≤ 0 → onDeath → DestroyOnDeath removes the enemy.

If breach

GoalZone adds Sepsis and removes the enemy. Sepsis 100 triggers defeat.

HUD reflects state

Clock ring (phase, progress, planning wedge), ATP text, Meters (Inflammation/Sepsis).

Everything updates via events or per-frame reads (no GC spikes).

What’s already meeting acceptance

Short survival run is playable.

Planning windows slow time and restore reliably; wedge visual animates.

Towers kill enemies; Mark raises damage; Neutralize stacks cap.

Slow cap respected (−70% after resist).

ATP accrues on a 6s cadence (unscaled), scaled by phase (and taxed next phase by Inflammation).

Sepsis rises on breaches; defeat hook available at 100.

Clean mental model (cheat sheet)

Systems: Time (Clock) → Economy (Bank) → Meta (Inflammation/Sepsis) → GlobalModifiers.

World: Lanes (Splines) → Spawners → Enemies (Mover + Health + Status + CC).

Player: BuildNodes + PlacementController (+ Costs) → Towers (Targeting + Shooter + Projectile).

Combat: Projectile → DamagePacket → Health → Death/Popup/Status.

UI: ClockRingHUD + Resource HUD + MetersHUD.
